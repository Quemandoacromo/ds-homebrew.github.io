# 卸载 Unlaunch

::: danger

Installing or uninstalling Unlaunch, while safe, writes to the console's NAND, so there's a small chance to brick your console!

**WARNING:** While uninstalling Unlaunch is relatively safe, there is still a small chance of bricking your Nintendo DSi. 这里有一些关于您可能想要卸载Unlaunch，但并不需要卸载Unlaunch就可解决问题的例子。

- **I don't want to use a custom menu anymore and I don't like having the Unlaunch file menu show on boot:** You can follow the [Unlaunch post install steps](installing-unlaunch.html#section-iv-post-unlaunch-configuration) to have Unlaunch autoboot the DSi menu
- **The Unlaunch Background is scary:** [Reinstall Unlaunch](installing-unlaunch.html) by selecting one of the available custom backgrounds
