# Launching the Exploit (stylehax)

We'll start by first launching our exploit. For the best Unlaunch-free experience, or if the DSi camera is broken to install Unlaunch, we recommend using an exploit called "stylehax" which takes advantage of a flaw in how the DSi Browser application handles webpages.

运行这个漏洞，它就会引导进入 TWiLight Menu++ ，一个DSi菜单的自制替换版本。

## 首先需要…

- Nintendo DSi Browser installed on your Nintendo DSi
  - If you do not have the DSi Browser, then use [Memory Pit](launching-the-exploit.html) instead

## Launching the exploit

1. Ensure your SD card is inserted into your Nintendo DSi
2. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the DSi Browser application
3. Touch the `Go to Page` button
   - The button will have a green `www` icon
4. Type `opera:about`, and touch `Go` to load the page
5. Touch the HOME icon
6. Touch the `Go to Page` button
7. Type `stylehax.net`, and touch `Go` to load the page

::: tip

The exploit should take 21 seconds to take effect. If it takes longer than 30 seconds, then reboot, and try again.

::: warning

If the top screen turns green, you do not have TWiLight Menu++'s `BOOT.NDS` on the root of your SD card. Follow the [prep work](get-started.html#section-i-prep-work) again.

:::

You can now use **TW**i**L**ight Menu++! First, it will ask you to select your language and region. These do not need to match your console's language or region, so set them to whichever you prefer. Next, it's recommended to continue on and make a NAND backup. This can potentially be used to save your console if anything bad happens in the future.

::: tip

Continue to [Dumping NAND](dumping-nand.html)
