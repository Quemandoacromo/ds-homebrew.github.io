# 运行漏洞

我们首先准备好SD卡来启动漏洞。 对于大多数用户，我们建议用一个叫做“Memory Pit”的漏洞，是一个利用Nintendo DSi Camera（iQue DSi 趣照）应用在处理数据时存在的漏洞实现的。

## 第一节 - 检查您的DSi趣照版本

1. 打开主机电源
2. 打开你的“iQue DSi趣照”软件
   - 如果你之前从未完成相机启动教程，请将它立即做完。
   - 如果在完成教程的过程中你的程序报错了， 请使用[alternate exploit](alternate-exploits.html)
3. 使用右侧的按钮打开相册
4.

## 第二节 - Memory Pit

1. Download the correct Memory Pit binary for your Nintendo DSi Camera version:
   - [If you _**did**_ have a Facebook icon](/assets/files/memory_pit/768_1024/pit.bin)
   - [If you did _**not**_ have a Facebook icon](/assets/files/memory_pit/256/pit.bin)
2. Navigate to `sd:/private/ds/app/484E494A/` on your SD card
   - `sd:` is the root of the SD card
   - You will already have these directories if you have previously taken photos to your SD card via the Nintendo DSi Camera application
   - If they (or just `484E494A`) do not exist, please insert the SD card into your DSi, launch the DSi Camera application, and then select the SD Card icon in the top-right for the folder(s) to be created
     - If you receive a message saying your SD card isn't inserted, please use another SD card
     - If you receive a message saying that your SD card cannot be used, ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-card-setup.html)
3. Inside the `484E494A` folder, rename the existing `pit.bin` file to `tip.bin`
4. Place the Memory Pit `pit.bin` file in the `484E494A` folder
5. If there's a folder named `DCIM` in the root of your SD card, make a back up of it so you don't lose the pictures inside, and then remove it from the SD card

## Section III - Launching the exploit

1. 确保你的DSi插入了准备好的SD卡
2. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the Nintendo DSi Camera application
3. Select the SD Card icon in the top-right
   - If you receive a message saying your SD card isn't inserted, please use another SD card
   - If you receive a message saying that your SD card cannot be used, ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-card-setup.html)
4. 使用右侧的按钮打开相册
   - The screen should flash magenta if Memory Pit was copied correctly

::: warning

If you enter the SD card camera album and nothing unusual happens, ensure that you downloaded the correct version of Memory Pit for your version and region, and placed it into the correct folder on your SD card. Also ensure that the `DCIM` folder does not exist on your SD card.

:::

::: warning

If the top screen turns green, you do not have `boot.nds` (which is dumpTool in this case) on the root of your SD card. 请按照[准备工作](get-started.html#section-i-prep-work)的指引将其准备好。  
If the issue persists despite `boot.nds` existing on the SD card root, please use an [alternate exploit](alternate-exploits.html).

:::

::: warning

Taking photos with the Memory Pit exploit on your SD card will cause the exploit to stop working properly and you will have to copy it over again.

:::

If the dumpTool menu appears, continue on and make a NAND backup. 如果未来出现任何故障，你可以随时使用这个备份来救机。
