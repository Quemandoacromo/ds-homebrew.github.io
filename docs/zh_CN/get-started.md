# 开始

The main homebrew application this guide has you install is **TW**i**L**ight Menu++, which is an upgrade/replacement to the Nintendo DSi Menu that allows running other homebrew applications, retail DS games, emulators for various older systems, and more.

我们将从下载它以及其他一些自制程序工具开始，以便为接下来的利用漏洞破解做准备。

## 首先需要…

- 将下载的文件复制到SD卡的方法
- An application that can extract archives, such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (Windows), [The Unarchiver](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353) (macOS), or [ZArchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver) (Chromebook)
  - 我们不建议您使用WinRAR，因为它可能会损坏数据
  - 如果您正在使用 Windows 11，我们也建议您不要使用它的内置解压 (Windows资源管理器)， 它会导致一个错误，说文件名太长或无效

## 第一步 – 准备工作

::: warning

Ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-card-setup.html).

:::

1. 将您的 SD 卡插入计算机
2. Download the latest release of [TWiLight Menu++](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases/latest/download/TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z)
   - If it does not download, open the [release page](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases/latest), and download `TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z`
3. Download the latest release of [dumpTool](https://github.com/zoogie/dumpTool/releases/latest/download/dumpTool.nds)
4. Open `TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z`
   - 如果您正在使用 Windows，请确认 7-Zip 已经安装，然后遵循以下步骤：
     1. Right-click on `TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z`
     2. If using Windows 11, click `Show more options`
     3. Hover over `7-zip`
     4. Click `Open archive`
5. Copy the `_nds` folder from `TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z` to the root of your SD card
6. Copy the `BOOT.NDS` file from `TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z` to the root of your SD card
7. Close `TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z`
8. Copy the `dumpTool.nds` file to the root of your SD card

## 第二步 — 选择漏洞

从这里开始，你有三个选项，每个选项的工作量略有不同。

### Installing Unlaunch via Memory Pit

Memory Pit is an exploit utilizing the DSi Camera, compatible with all firmware versions. Optionally, this exploit can be used to install Unlaunch, a bootcode exploit that allows full control of the console on boot.

As Memory Pit is somewhat limited in homebrew compatibility, it is recommended to install Unlaunch, instead of using Memory Pit standalone. As this is the easiest method to install Unlaunch, this is the recommended path. However, there is a very minor risk of **bricking** your console when installing Unlaunch, so if this is a concern, see the alternate method below.

:::

### stylehax

stylehax is an exploit utilizing the DSi Browser application, and can be used as an alternative to Memory Pit for installing Unlaunch (explained above) if your DSi has a broken camera.

For an Unlaunch-free experience, this exploit is recommended as using Memory Pit causes issues in some games and homebrew.

:::

### Flipnote Lenny

Flipnote Lenny is an exploit utilizing the Flipnote Studio application.

If you have Flipnote Studio and do not plan on installing Unlaunch (explained above), this exploit is recommended for the same reason as stylehax.

You can always install Unlaunch later if you decide later on that you want it.
