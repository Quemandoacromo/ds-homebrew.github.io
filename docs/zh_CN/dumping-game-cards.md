# Dumping Game Cards

This section is for dumping Game Cards using GodMode9i so they can be played on emulators, flashcards, or your SD card via nds-bootstrap.

## 首先需要…

- The Game Card of the title you would like to dump
- Your Nintendo DSi console with [Unlaunch](installing-unlaunch.html) installed

## 操作步骤

### 第一节 - SD 卡设置

1. Download the latest release of [GodMode9i](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases)
2. Extract `GodMode9i.nds` from the GodMode9i archive and place it anywhere on your SD card

### 第二节——DSi上的操作

1. Launch GodMode9i
2. Ensure the Game Card is inserted into the console
3. Select the "NDS GAMECARD" option in GodMode9i
4. Select what you want to dump
   - The "Trimmed" options for the ROM will dump a smaller file that can save SD card space, however they won't work for most patches such as ROM hacks
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all Game Cards you wish to dump

::: tip

The dumped Game Cards will be found in `sd:/gm9i/out`.
