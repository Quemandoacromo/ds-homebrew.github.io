# 其他漏洞

如果你按照本教程在启动Nintendo DSi 相机应用时遇到闪退，那么Memory Pit将不适用 Here, you may find alternate exploits that may work in lieu of Memory Pit.

If you have Flipnote Studio installed, you can use [Flipnote Lenny](launching-the-flipnote-exploit.html).

::: tip

Ensure you have set up [TWiLight Menu++](get-started.html#section-i-prep-work) on your SD card before proceeding with any of the following.

:::

If you're on an older firmware, you may have access to save game exploits for a select [list of games](https://dsibrew.org/wiki/DSi_exploits#DSiWare\(True_DSi-Mode\)_Exploits). These will not be covered here as they are largely obsolete. They should only be used as a last resort, if both Memory Pit and Flipnote Lenny aren't working for you.

petit-compwner will not be usable for the purpose of working around Memory Pit, as it requires a working camera to launch the exploit.
