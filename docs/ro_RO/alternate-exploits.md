- If you have Flipnote Studio installed, you can use [Flipnote Lenny](launching-the-flipnote-exploit.html).

### Others

If you're on an older firmware, you may have access to save game exploits for a select [list of games](https://dsibrew.org/wiki/DSi_exploits#DSiWare\(True_DSi-Mode\)_Exploits). These will not be covered here as they are largely obsolete. They should only be used as a last resort, if Memory Pit, stylehax, and Flipnote Lenny aren't working for you.

petit-compwner will not be usable for the purpose of working around Memory Pit, as it requires a working camera to launch the exploit.
