# Dezinstalarea Unlaunch

::: danger

Installing or uninstalling Unlaunch, while safe, writes to the console's NAND, so there's a small chance to brick your console!

:::

**WARNING:** While uninstalling Unlaunch is relatively safe, there is still a small chance of bricking your Nintendo DSi. Aici sunt câteva cazuri despre motivul pentru care vrei să dezinstalezi Unlaunch dar cu soluți care nu necesită dezinstalare.

- **I don't want to use a custom menu anymore and I don't like having the Unlaunch file menu show on boot:** You can follow the [Unlaunch post install steps](installing-unlaunch.html#section-iv-post-unlaunch-configuration) to have Unlaunch autoboot the DSi menu
- **The Unlaunch Background is scary:** [Reinstall Unlaunch](installing-unlaunch.html) by selecting one of the available custom backgrounds
- **I'm having an issue with Unlaunch or my console after installing it:** The [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html#unlaunch) page will explain how to fix many issues you may have

::: warning

Pentru a reduce șansele de brick, asigură-te că nu ai instalat DSiWare nelegitim pe copia de NAND (redirecționarea SDNAND de la hiyaCFW nu se pune), sau dacă ai umblat la fișierele de sistem.

Once you have reviewed the above information, follow the [Installing Unlaunch](installing-unlaunch.html) instructions up to the uninstall part.
